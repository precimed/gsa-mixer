Resulting data has 
n=337145 individuals and 
m=12926669 variants

Samples QC is based on ukb_sqc_v2.txt file:
- keep unrelated individuals (used.in.pca.calculation), 
- keep white British ancestry subset (in.white.British.ancestry.subset),
- remove sex chromosome aneuploidy (putative.sex.chromosome.aneuploidy),
- exclude withdrawn participants

Variants QC is based on ukb_mfi_chr@_v3.txt files (provided by UKB) and afreq/hardy/vmiss files calculated by us for the subset of 337145 individuals. 
We keep autosomes only, apply PLINKs –maf 0.001 –geno 0.1 –hwe 1e-10, in addition to filtering out variants with INFO below 0.8 and excluding SNPs with
duplicated SNP ID (all such SNPs were excluded, i.e. without keeping first or last occurrence). 

Some numbers: 
TOTAL SNPs - 93095623; 
MAF below 0.001 - 76572747; 
VMISS above 0.1 - 487462; 
HWE below 1e-10 - 217482; 
INFO below 0.8 - 64154249; 
duplicated SNP label - 637921; 
remain after filtering 12926669. (off note, the number without dropping duplicated SNP labels would be 12992936). 
The numbers above are for 22 autosomes, in addition we have 3917799 SNPs (in total) on chrX, and 45906 on chrXY.
